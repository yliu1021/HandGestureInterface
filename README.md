# Hand Gesture Interface

Using machine learning to power intuitive human computer interfaces.

## Getting Started

Hand Gesture Interface requires Python 3 to be installed and a working webcam. Currently, only MacOS is supported but support for Windows and Linux is coming soon.

After downloading, simply double click the ```run``` script. It will automatically set up the appropriate Python environment and install the correct pip packages. Note that everything is done in a Python virtual environment in the same directory as the ```run``` file so you don't need to worry about package conflicts.

If you wish to uninstall, simply delete the folder that the ```run``` script is in. There's no need to delete any other packages.
